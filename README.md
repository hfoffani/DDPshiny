This app compares European countries with regards to their number of Hospital
beds and, within those, the beds reserved for psychiatric pacients. The number
of beds are relative the countries populations.

There are four different plots: the Total Hospital beds per country, the number
of Psychiatric beds per country, the percentage of Psyc related to Hospital
beds per country and a comparison between Psychiatric beds vs. non-psyc beds.

The slider let the user set the range for the quantiles.
The defaults are 25% and 75%.
